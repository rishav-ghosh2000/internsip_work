At first, I did sentiment analysis on the tweets in Hindi and Bengali languages that I manually collected from Twitter. The codes on this are present on tweets_sentimentAnalysis.
In this, I have used the Vader sentiment analyzer to analyze the sentiment of the tweets whether it is positive, neutral, or negative. Then I did the label and saved it in another file named output_file_tweets.
Then I applied transformers to predict the sentiment of tweets and compared the result of those with Vader's one.
Then I created a manual Niave Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic regression model from scratch. And by that, I predicted the label of those tweets means supervised learning.

Next, I made a dataset of fake news and applied Niave Bayes, Random Forest, and LSTM models to predict whether it was fake or real. And then I created a paper based on this observation. The paper is named 'intern_researchPaper'.
